# lv-post-installer

lv-post-installer provides the ability to manage application dependencies post-install. The post installer package can be used to manage (install, un-install, migrate, backup) application dependencies as code. Keep in mind that the post installer is compiled into the application, so it's not possible to load plugins at runtime (feel free to compile it into a lvlibp if you need that functionality).
